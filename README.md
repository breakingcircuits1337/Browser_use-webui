## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Option 1: Local Installation

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/breakingcircuits1337/bcs-browser.git
cd bcs-browser
```

#### Step 2: Set Up Python Environment
We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for managing the Python environment.

Using uv (recommended):
```bash
uv venv --python 3.11
```

Activate the virtual environment:
- Windows (Command Prompt):
```cmd
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
- Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
- macOS/Linux:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install Python packages:
```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install Playwright:
```bash
playwright install
```

#### Step 4: Configure Environment
1. Create a copy of the example environment file:
- Windows (Command Prompt):
```bash
copy .env.example .env
```
- macOS/Linux/Windows (PowerShell):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
2. Open `.env` in your preferred text editor and add your API keys and other settings.

---

### Option 2: Docker Installation

#### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed

#### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/breakingcircuits1337/bcs-browser.git
cd bcs-browser
```

2. Create and configure environment file:
- Windows (Command Prompt):
```bash
copy .env.example .env
```
- macOS/Linux/Windows (PowerShell):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit `.env` with your preferred text editor and add your API keys.

3. Run with Docker:
```bash
# Build and start the container with default settings
docker compose up --build
```
```bash
# Or run with persistent browser
CHROME_PERSISTENT_SESSION=true docker compose up --build
```

4. Access the Application:
- Web Interface: Open `http://localhost:7788` in your browser.
- VNC Viewer: Open `http://localhost:6080/vnc.html` to watch browser interactions.

## Usage

### Local Setup
1. **Run the WebUI**:
```bash
python webui.py --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 7788
```
2. **Access the WebUI**: Open `http://127.0.0.1:7788` in your browser.
3. **Configure Browser Settings**: Use the WebUI to set up your browser and LLM preferences.

### Docker Setup
1. **Environment Variables**: Configure settings in the `.env` file.
2. **Container Management**:
```bash
# Start with persistent browser
CHROME_PERSISTENT_SESSION=true docker compose up -d

# Stop the container
docker compose down
```

## Known Issues
- Some functions are still under development and may not work as expected.
- Browser persistence may occasionally fail on certain systems.

---

## Roadmap
- **Voice Control**: Adding voice-based interaction for hands-free operation.
- **Enhanced LLM Integration**: Expanding support for additional LLMs and improving existing integrations.
- **Improved Error Handling**: Making the system more robust and user-friendly.
